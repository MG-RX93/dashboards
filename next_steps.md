# Next Steps:
Common Fields between tables:
- transaction_date
- description
- category
- tags
- amount
- created_at
- updated_at

Key Differences:
1. Bank transactions have:
   - account_name
   - bank_name
   - transaction_type (credit/debit)

2. Credit transactions have:
   - credit_card_name
   - issuing_bank

Recommended Approach:
Creating a unified view/table with an ETL script approach because:

1. Both scripts already follow the same pattern:
   - CSV → Clean → Parquet → PostgreSQL
2. The data structures are very similar
3. You have good error handling and logging in place
4. The transformation logic is consistent

Implementation Plan:

1. Create a unified transactions table with:
   - All common fields
   - A source_type field (credit/bank)
   - Account identifier fields (combining account/card info)
   - Bank identifier fields (combining bank/issuing bank)

2. Create a new Python script that will:
   - Inherit common functionality from existing scripts
   - Handle both types of transactions
   - Apply consistent categorization
   - Maintain source information

3. For the dashboard:
   - Create a view that combines both tables
   - Add source-specific fields as nullable columns
   - Standardize the transaction type (credit cards are always 'debit')

## Complete Pipeline Flow:

1. Data Ingestion
   - Parse filenames (bankname_accounttype.csv)
   - Validate CSV structure

2. Pre-Processing
   - Clean dates, amounts, descriptions
   - Handle missing values
   - Standardize text fields
   - Initial validation checks

3. AI Categorization
   - Send to OpenAI API
   - Cache frequent transactions
   - Assign categories and confidence scores
   - Store categorization rules

4. Transformation
   - Map to unified schema
   - Calculate running balances
   - Add metadata (source_type, transaction_type)
   - Generate statement_month
   - Flag recurring transactions

5. Database Loading
   - Load to unified table
   - Update indexes
   - Verify data integrity
   - Log processing results

6. Post-Processing Views
   - Monthly summaries
   - Asset/liability categorization
   - Balance calculations
   - Spending patterns

Would you like to proceed with either:
1. SQL schema details for views
2. AI categorization implementation
3. Data validation rules
