Tips for Setting Up Metrics in Grafana:
	1.	Define SQL Queries: Write efficient SQL queries in Postgres to retrieve the necessary data for each metric.
	2.	Aggregation: Use SQL functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, and GROUP BY for aggregating your data.
	3.	Time Series Data: Ensure your transaction table has a timestamp column to enable time-series charts.
	4.	Filters: Provide filters for categories, merchants, date ranges, etc., using Grafana’s variable feature.
	5.	Thresholds & Alerts: Set thresholds on charts for alerts, such as spending exceeding a certain amount.
	6.	Dashboard Organization: Group related metrics on the same dashboard for easy navigation.

By implementing these visualizations and metrics in Grafana, you can comprehensively analyze your credit card expenses and take actionable steps to optimize your spending. Let me know if you need assistance with specific SQL queries or Grafana configuration!
